The Great Hedgehog Cake Race

What is it about hedgehogs being speedy?  That's not really a question we answer in this Java clone/mod of the classic game "Igel Ã¤rgern."  Four to Six players take control of their hedgehogs, who must brave a grassy field filled with pits, black holes, wormholes, and trampolines in order to reach their favorite food: cake!  Compete with your friends sharing the same computer screen. Force them into sticky situations, trap them under your own hedgehogs, or just race straight ahead to reach the finish line, where the cake is most certainly not a lie!

Notes:
Written in 2009 for a class project.  Black holes, wormholes, and trampolines are my own ideas; part of the project was developing new and interesting modifications on the standard 'pit.'  The hedgehogs are based on a design drawn by my fiance, as is the idea of cake.  The original game seemed to have very little going for it in the way of motivation.
